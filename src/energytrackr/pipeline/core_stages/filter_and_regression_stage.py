"""Module to filter commits and add regression context based on configuration.

This merged stage first applies filtering criteria to the commit list,
then uses the original commit order along with the configuration parameters
(min_commits_before and min_commits_after) to ensure that each candidate commit
has a previous and/or a next commit for comparison. If a neighboring commit was removed
during filtering, it is added back from the original list.
